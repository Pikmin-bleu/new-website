      As a foreigner Addyson Bonner makes pieces in discussion with the abundant unescapable presence of the US when growing up on the internet and on the US’s presence in his personal life. Bonner explores themes of early internet nostalgia, furry culture, transgender identity, sexual taboos through his work and the alienation one can feel when unsure where they belong. Currently Bonner focuses on stretchy synthetic fabrics for their quality of deforming the image; he is looking to explore natural stretchy materials in the future, particularly with knits. Bonner is currently studying at the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago with a focus in Fiber and Fashion.
