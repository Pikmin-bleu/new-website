      My work is playful and laughs at itself. It observes the problems of a hurting human ego from an outside perspective. Every emotion in my sculptures is caricatured, like anger that is taunt or overwhelming joy. I explore textile sculptures for their ability to give softness and life to a body and children‚Äôs book-like characters for their simple display of humanity. My work exists in the same space as toys and serves as a playground for emotions to let loose. I want my sculptures to be the friends of those who view them and remind them to give themselves grace about being sensitive ridiculous beings. My work also explores questions of identity or freedom from human markers through escaping what is defined as human.
