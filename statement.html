      As a french person in Chicago I make pieces in discussion with the abundant unescapable presence of the US. I explore themes of early internet nostalgia, furry culture, transgender identity, sexual taboos and the alienation one can feel when unsure where they belong. Currently I focuse on stretchy synthetic fabrics for their quality of deforming the image; I am also looking to explore natural stretchy materials in the future, particularly with knits. I am currently studying at the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago with a focus in Fiber and Fashion.
