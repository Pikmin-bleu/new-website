      My work is playful and laughs at itself. It observes the problems of a hurting human ego from an outside perspective. All emotions in my art are personified, like anger that is taut or crybaby tantrums. I explore textile skins on sculptures for their ability to give softness and life to a body and children‚Äôs book-like characters for their simple display of humanity. My work exists in the same space as toys and serves as a playground for emotions to let loose. I want my sculptures and wearables to be the friends of those who view them and remind them to give themselves grace about being sensitive ridiculous beings. My work also explores questions of identity through escaping what is defined as human by tying us to relatable inhuman characters.
