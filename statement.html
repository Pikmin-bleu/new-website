      Addyson Bonner (b. 2003) is a French American artist who makes colorful sculptures and wearables. Bonner works with emblems; symbols that are figurative like cartoon red dogs or inanimate like text, that he uses as self portraits. As a transgender artist, Bonner explores themes of identification to emblems as a way of understanding oneself and navigating one's emotions. Influenced by Japanese mascots and Pokemon monsters Bonner brings to life his emblems through sewing, felting, knitting and printing.
